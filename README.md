# Proactively Stocking Inventory using ML

## Background

How do you notify store associates when items are out of stock? What if you could leverage footage from in-store cameras to detect when stock is low for items that have a quick turnover (like produce) and have those refilled before running out? In this session, weâ€™ll walk through an architecture that describes how to combine camera footage, the Cloud Vision API, and Firebase to deliver an end-to-end use case to help shoppers get the products they need without having to wait.

## Tasks

- Sample images uploaded to Cloud Storage
- Cloud Storage bucket notification to Cloud Pub/Sub
- Cloud Pub/Sub push to App Engine app, to analyze image
- Based on Vision API response, send message to Pub/Sub
- Cloud Pub/Sub push to App Engine app to send device notification
- Firebase delivers push notification
